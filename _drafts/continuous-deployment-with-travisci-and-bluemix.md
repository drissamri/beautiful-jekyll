I recently [moved](https://drissamri.be/blog/2015/09/02/hosting-a-jekyll-website-on-bluemix/) my website to Bluemix.
The next step is to make sure the latest version of the site is deployed without manual intervention. After every Git commit I want automatic deployment, since my website is open source on GitHub I'm able to use TravisCI for free. Perfect time to give it a shot since I've never used it before.
